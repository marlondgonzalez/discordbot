Discord Bot notes

Essentials
 - create database table for streamers, include: DiscordName, Discriminant, TwitchName, TwitchNotificationID
   - This table will be referenced by TwitchAPI.getActiveSubscriptions() to key TwitchNotificationID with DiscordName/Discriminant in order to change roles
   - Need to create change roles functions for "Streaming Live" role
 - get specific roles by reacting, eliminating need to mute channels not interested in or notifications for any type of streamers
 - change channel variables to pull channel_id's instead of guild.text_channels[index] to avoid breaking if order is changed
 - don't forget to credit anyone whose code on github helped create this project
 - watch out for duplicate streaming notifications, I think pinging the heroku website every 15 minutes should alleviate this problem but need to make sure

Desired
 - levels?
 - security system?
 - automatically respond to special words (mostly for fun)
 - have steam / other launchers id's command for certain users

Technical
 - use "taskkill /f /im ngrok.exe" to kill off any ngrok tunnels that are active
 - change URL's and apisecretcode when deploying on server
