Discord Bot notes

Essentials
 - get specific roles by reacting, eliminating need to mute channels not interested in or notifications for any type of streamers
 - get auto shouted by reacting
 - "add command" command
 - don't forget to credit anyone whose code on github helped create this project

Desired
 - levels?
 - security system?
 - automatically respond to special words (mostly for fun)
 - have steam / other launchers id's command for certain users

What to do when I get full access to server:
 - change channel variables to pull channel_id's instead of guild.text_channels[index] to avoid breaking if order is changed

Technical
 - use "taskkill /f /im ngrok.exe" to kill off any ngrok tunnels that are active
 - change URL's and apisecretcode when deploying on server
